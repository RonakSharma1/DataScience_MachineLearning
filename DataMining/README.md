# General
1. These files describe the data mining techniques performed on the raw and unstructured data. Doing so helped transform this data, into a structured format thus making it fit for training a model

2. For both Force and Vibration datasets, these were first sanitised and then structured. After that, they were subjected to feature extraction techniques like PCA and Normalisation
