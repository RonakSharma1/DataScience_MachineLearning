# General:
This is my final year project, which comprised of performing data analysis, designing machine learning models and applying optimisation. A [GUI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m0hZkJXE3TtX05IuilRyTRLyBysoKkus/view?usp=sharing) was then developed to incoorporate all these techniques into a single standalone application. Each subfolder provides a detailed description of each of the earlier mentioned techniques.

# Aim
Design a systems engineering framework to predict the optimal surface metrology parameters such as force and vibration, required to achieve the desired surface roughness of a manufactured product

# Setup
For each executable file, it can be just downloaded from Git and then opened in MATLAB 2016b or above. Detailed instructions can be found in each subfolder 

# Repository Structure
1. A PDF presentation to provide the motivation and background to the problem statement

2. GUI: This folder can be cloned and ran directly in MATLAB. This contains all the technical work performed as part of this project in a single Software Application.

3. DataMining: Contains the scripts for performing data mining on the raw data. The scripts are non-executable as the data cannot be shared due to CONFIDENTIALITY

4. NeuralNetwork: Contains the scripts that perform 'feature extraction' and 'model training'. The scripts can be cloned and ran using the mock data provided

5. Optimisation: Contains the scripts required to optimise the models created in '4'. These model are optimised to determine the optimal values for the Nine features required to achieve the user defined surface roughness value. Refer to this folder for better understanding
